# Part 1

- six-frame translation: confirm it's protein-coding and identify the correct frame
- homology search: search for functional domains and homology to known proteins
- functional annotation: identify conserved domains that might indicate virulence factors, toxins, or immunomodulatory functions
- select agent cross-referencing: assess if it's a controlled sequence
- risk assessment: represents a regulated pathogen or a functional part of a toxin?

=> flag if it's from a regulated pathogen, encodes a known toxin/virulence factor, or could enhance pathogenicity
